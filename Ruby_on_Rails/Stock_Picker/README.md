# Substring

Demonstration of finding substring in entered string. 

User will be prompted to enter word or sentence. Afterwards, that string will be passed in method `substring` which will compare whole string with predetermined dictionary. For every word in dictionary that is found in string hash value will be incremented by one. At the end, hash of words from dictionary found in string will be displayed. Keys will be words themselves, while values will be count.

There is a bug, where it will count only first substring that is found. If word with multiple same substring is entered, count will only go up by one. Maybe use `scan` method?

# Stock picker

This code is simple demonstration of data manipulation and structuring with arrays. `stock_picker` method will take array of values, that represent buy/sell prices for day on stock. Idea is to find pair of the days that it's best to buy and sell on.

Code relies to heavily on math, and i'm not satisfied with solution I have written. It can be refactored even further, but at current level of knowledge im not confident enough to try and refactor this code. There should be some method or methods that would shorten this code. I'll try and return to this code when I learn more about Ruby
