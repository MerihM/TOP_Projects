# LibHandDis

Based on scans of “Library Hand - Disjoint”, described in
Dana's
[A Library Primer](https://archive.org/details/primerlibrary00danarich "A Library Primer"),
with some modifications.

(via discussion on MetaFilter, [This question of library handwriting is an exceedingly practical one](https://www.metafilter.com/165171/This-question-of-library-handwriting-is-an-exceedingly-practical-one "This question of library handwriting is an exceedingly practical one"))

## Coverage

ASCII and a bit.

## Major changes from scan

* As the scan only covered A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and ‘&’, I had to make the rest
up. 

* Many of the descenders had to be shortened to fit with modern
typography conventions.

* Kerning is much tighter than Dana's guidelines suggest.

## Source

Source is included in FontForge format. As is the scan from p.70 of
Dana's book that I used as a source.
