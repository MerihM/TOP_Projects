TT2020 is an advanced, mulilingual and free typewriter font family for a new decade.

This font includes ten copies of each glyph. This means that it is guaranteed that in a string of ten characters, such as "EEEEEEEEEE", all E's will look different.

TT2020's glyph selection works in most programs, but not all.

TT2020 is currently in beta. This is style "D". The family is licensed under the SIL Open Font License.
