    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Za'atar bread is known in the Middle East as mana'eesh. Homemade dough is topped with za'atar, a spice mixture
        composed of sesame seeds, oregano, marjoram, and thyme.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 cups warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))</li>
        <li>6 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons za'atar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Mix in 3 cups flour and salt. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2
                cup
                at a time, beating well after each addition. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead until smooth, about 10 minutes. Place dough in
                a
                greased bowl; turn to coat with oil. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Divide dough into 16 equal pieces and form into rounds. Roll into 1/4-inch-thick circles. Poke rounds
                with
                your fingers to create small indentations. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Mix za'atar and olive oil together in a small bowl. Spread over circles. Place on ungreased baking
                sheets.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until dough is golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
