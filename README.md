# Balanced Binary search tree

Implementation of Balanced BST data structure in Ruby. This implementation contains methods that build BST from array, 
insert data in BST from passed argument, delete node from BST, find required data in BST, show both BFS and DFS algorithms for traversal, find height of BST, find depth of node in BST, check if BST if balanced, and rebalance BST
