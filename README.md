# Bubble Sort

This is demonstration of bubble sort algorithm. Bubble sort algorithm is one of simplest sorting algorithms but it's quite processor-intensive. Sorting is done by comparing element with element next to it, and if its greater than next one their places are swapped. This is done with every element. It works fine with smaller arrays, but it would take forever on large arrays. Time complexity is O(n^2).

I tried to shorten the code as much as possible, and this is what I settled for.
