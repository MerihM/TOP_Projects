# Knights travails

This project demonstrates path that a knight would take to get from one position on board to other. It was implemented
as a spanning tree data structure. This was my first attempt at graph data structure. There is a lot of room for improvement, but for first try without any guidance it was decent. With few more methods target location could be selected because every move and every path to it is already calculated and stored in a spanning tree.
