# Ruby Tic Tac Toe

This is a demonstration of Tic-Tac-Toe game with simple grid. Grid is drawn in console, and is updated every time new symbol is entered. 

There are a few bugs in this code, but it works. When someone wins it's printed out, except when someone wins on one of diagonals. This should be a simple fix.

I had to rewrite whole drawing grid part. First one was too big, and it would take me a long time to get it to work. I've settled with smaller, simpler version.
