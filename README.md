# Stock picker

This code is simple demonstration of data manipulation and structuring with arrays. `stock_picker` method will take array of values, that represent buy/sell prices for day on stock. Idea is to find pair of the days that it's best to buy and sell on.

Code relies to heavily on math, and i'm not satisfied with solution I have written. It can be refactored even further, but at current level of knowledge im not confident enough to try and refactor this code. There should be some method or methods that would shorten this code. I'll try and return to this code when I learn more about Ruby
