    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy onigiri recipe is also fun to make! These rice balls are a staple of Japanese lunchboxes (bento). You
        can
        put almost anything in these rice balls; try substituting grilled salmon, pickled plums, beef, pork, turkey, or
        tuna
        with mayonnaise.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
        <li>5.5 cups water, divided</li>
        <li>0.25 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>0.25 cup bonito shavings (dry fish flakes)</li>
        <li>2 sheets nori (dry seaweed), cut into 0.5 inch strips</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Wash rice in a mesh strainer until water runs clear. Combine washed rice and 4 1/2 cups water in a
                saucepan.
                Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low; cover, and simmer rice until
                water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Let rice rest for 15 minutes to continue to steam and become
                tender.
                Allow cooked rice to cool. </p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Combine remaining 1 cup water with salt in a small bowl; use to dampen hands before handling rice. Divide
                cooked rice into 8 equal portions. Use one portion of rice for each onigiri. </p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Divide one portion of rice in two. Create a dimple in rice and fill with a heaping teaspoon of bonito
                flakes.
                Cover with remaining portion of rice and press lightly to enclose filling inside rice ball. Gently press
                rice to shape into a triangle; wrap with a strip of nori and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Repeat with
                remaining portions of rice. </p>

        </li>
    </ol>
